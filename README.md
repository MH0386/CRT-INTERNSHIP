# CRT-INTERNSHIP

Coding Raja Technologies Internship in Machine Learning.

## TASK 1: Spam Detection

Build a machine learning model that can detect spam emails or messages. You can use a dataset like Enron Spam and a framework like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow to build the model.

## Task 2: Product Recommendation

Build a machine learning model that can recommend products to users based on their past behavior and preferences. You can use a dataset like Amazon Product Reviews and a framework like TensorFlow or Scikit-Learn to build the model.

## Task 3: Handwriting Recognition

Create a machine learning model that can recognize handwritten digits or characters. You can use a dataset like MNIST or EMNIST and a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build the model.
